# PeltierCell
Code and acquired data from a Process Modelling and Control course project. This involved the realization of a Peltier cell support with one cooling side (using a fan) and one heating side (using a 3D printer extruder). After characterizing the process, a control strategy has been developed to make the system able to follow a given reference.
